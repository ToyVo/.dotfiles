# dotfiles

basic dotfiles that I use, whereever possible I use the base16 material color scheme

some software that my dotfiles use:
* stow
* alacritty
* fish
* neofetch
* neovim
* papirus-icon-theme
* rofi
* ttf-fira-code
* zsh
* materia-gtk-theme
* i3-gaps
* i3-blocks

AUR packages that I like to use
* paru-bin
* starship-bin

to setup on a new install: clone to home directory, then run stow for each package to be used (stow * doesn't want to work with this README.md)
